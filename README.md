# Bj√∂rnstad Syndrome 

Bjornstad syndrome (BJS) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive mitochondrial disorder discovered by Professor Roar Bjornstad in 1965. The mutated disease gene, BCS1L, maps to chromosome 2q34-q36 and codes for a mitochondrial chaperone protein, a member of the AAA family of ATPases. The ATPase takes part in the mitochondrial electron transport chain by assembling the respiratory chain complex III. Complex III is responsible for generating the energy that cells require and also produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Even though this abnormal protein leads to a decrease in the activity of complex III, because of unknown reasons, the complex produces more tissue-damaging ROS instead of less. The hair follicles and cells of the inner ear are susceptible to mitochondrial function and consequently, ROS. So, mutated BCS1L causes sensorineural hearing loss and pili torti. The deafness is due to an impaired ability of the auditory nerves to transmit sensory input to the brain. Although the severity varies, this type of hearing loss is typically congenital and bilateral. Pili torti, flattening of hair shafts at irregular intervals and twisted 180 degrees from the normal axis, is usually recognized early in childhood and may become milder with age. Body hair may exhibit the same characteristic except for eyebrows and eyelashes. Pili torti eventually causes alopecia and a dry, fragile scalp. In order to characterize the variants that are VUS, we will first get the protein sequence for BCS1L from Uniprot and find homologous proteins from BlastP. Then, we will align the necessary amount of homologous proteins, build phylogenetic trees and reroot them using MEGA11 and FigTree. Then, we will prune the clade and map mutation-occurring sites to aligned sequences using Phyton.
